# Why.jl

Provides a single function `why()` which returns a randomly generated String giving an explanation. Example outputs:

"Because some harmless and properly type-safe cockatoo and the fast type pirate decided so."

"Some deceitful and vaguely self aware person and the programmer wanted it."

"Some not at all self aware and very self aware compiler and some deceitful research software engineer decided so."
